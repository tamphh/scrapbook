# Clever code is probably the worst code you could write
> And clear, readable code is probably the hardest code to write

When I was an undergrad, Leetcode broke my brain. I would see top solutions of esoteric one-liners and wrongly think ‚Äúhow do I ever get this good?‚Äù
```python
def minimumTotal(self, t):
    return reduce(lambda a,b:[f+min(d,e)for d,e,f in zip(a,a[1:],b)],t[::-1])[0]
```

This is commonly called ‚Äúcode golfing‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fun hobby, but very far from ‚Äúgood code.‚Äù

Everybody (including those on Leetcode) knows this isn‚Äôt good code. In the industry, it‚Äôs the worst code one could write.

However, on the other end of the spectrum, I realized eventually that the **clearest code was actually the hardest to write.**

It made sense retrospectively. Reviewing the code of a senior staff software engineer was much easier to follow and review compared to the code of an entry-level L3 engineer

### Clear code: the good and the bad
The ‚Äúpower‚Äù of clear code, for better or for worse, was made fully clear to me after a certain incident at work.

I once wrote a data enrichment module in C++, a language that is generally harder to read compared to other languages simply due to its verbosity.

I started with just two files (.h/.cpp) and all the implementation code went into just these two files.

The result was this giant, disgusting piece of spaghetti on the inside, but a perfectly working program on the outside.

This would _never_ get past code review.

I split the implementation into 30+ diffs. At the time I was working at a company that used [stacked diffs](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs). (This also happened to be my personal record for length of chained diffs, so I was pretty proud of the following outcome üôÇ).

Each diff was a neat, containerized piece of code, with convenient placeholders for dependencies that would arrive in a later diff. It had code neatly split out into helper functions and helper files when necessary.

Each diff had reasonable unit test coverage - the basics and some obvious edge cases were covered, but I didn‚Äôt go wastefully overboard with it.

Each diff also took me quite a few iterations of ‚Äúcode cleaning,‚Äù refactoring, and more. **It took a lot more effort than I expected to achieve ‚Äúclear code,‚Äù especially for such a large program.**

The result? _A beautiful landing of the data enrichment module, with easy to read, clear code._

While I was proud of it, there was suddenly a **problem** when I talked to my manager about it.

> ‚ÄúWhile I understand how complex this was, when it comes to performance reviews, this code looks trivial. It looks too easy, too simple.
> 
> I would recommend writing an implementation doc of this module just so we can demonstrate that this was actually quite complex.‚Äù

I was shocked - this wasn‚Äôt some startup. This was one of the biggest companies in the world, _known for their engineering culture_.

I now understood why Big Tech seemingly had so many docs ‚Äî half of the docs I wrote didn‚Äôt _need_ to be written, except they did‚Ä¶ because I wanted to get raises and be promoted.

While promotion culture in Big Tech is a story for another article (subscribe to see it in your inbox soon üôÇ), the main point here is that **great code is very clear and readable.**

There‚Äôs a [popular saying](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law) that **debugging code is twice as hard as writing it**. It‚Äôs the reason why when ChatGPT outputs some hogwash, it‚Äôs easier just to re-prompt it or write it from scratch yourself instead of trying to figure out the errors in its buggy code.

### Some other thoughts about clear code

-   The only way I got better at writing clear, readable code was just **writing a lot of code while strictly following a clear style guide.**
    
    -   Also, having more experienced devs review my code with a magnifying glass.
        
        -   It was agony to get tons of comments and ‚Äúnits‚Äù about seemingly pointless style in the beginning, but it paid off in the end.
            
-   Coding style is **more important** than I expected in the beginning. My start to software engineering started from being on the product-minded end of the spectrum and moved towards the ‚Äútechnical-minded‚Äù side of the spectrum.¬†
    
    -   I had started coding solely to start a business, so I initially only cared about code as a tool, resulting in crappy, unmaintainable code.
        
    -   It‚Äôs only through more experience with writing code and working within teams that the importance of clear, readable code became more obvious.
        
    -   It‚Äôs not just me. This is an obvious revelation to anybody who has been writing code in the industry for more than a year.

-   [Google probably has the most public style guide](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-google-writes-clean-maintainable). Vercel also recently released their [style guide](https://github.com/vercel/style-guide?utm_source=tldrwebdev), and pretty much every company uses some sort of linter and prettifier.
