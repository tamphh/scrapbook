### How to calculate the different possible combinations?
You need to determine the number of allowable characters. Then, there are

```(number of allowable characters)^5```

So, for example:

... if you are using the English alphabet of 26 letters, and the code is not case sensitive, and if you are using the ten decimal digits, you have a total of
number of allowable characters=26+10=36.

Then there are 5 letters, 36 options for each one:

```36 x 36 x 36 x 36 x 36 = 36^5```
