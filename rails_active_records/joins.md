## Different nested joins
Beware of the way you use joins in ActiveRecord, say User has one Profile, and Profile has many Skills. By default it uses INNER JOIN butâ€¦

```ruby
# DON'T
User.joins(:profiles).merge(Profile.joins(:skills))
=> SELECT users.* FROM users 
   INNER JOIN profiles    ON profiles.user_id  = users.id
   LEFT OUTER JOIN skills ON skills.profile_id = profiles.id
```
**So you'd rather use:**

```ruby
# DO
User.joins(profiles: :skills)
=> SELECT users.* FROM users 
   INNER JOIN profiles ON profiles.user_id  = users.id
   INNER JOIN skills   ON skills.profile_id = profiles.id
```

## Using ```joins``` with OR
There is a requirement when you use the Rails 5 ```.or``` method: both sides of the query must have a compatible structure. What does it mean?

```ruby
User.joins(:profile).where(name: "John").or(User.where(name: "Tom")).count
# => ArgumentError: Relation passed to #or must be structurally compatible. Incompatible values: [:joins]

User.joins(:profile).where(name: "John").or(User.joins(:profile).where(name: "Tom")).count
# => 2
```
Oh, this also happens with .includes as you probably imagined.

In fact, the only difference that can exist between both sides of the ```OR``` are the ```WHERE``` and ```HAVING``` clauses. Any other difference will throw out an ```ArgumentError``` claiming an incompatible structure.
